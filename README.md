### Attention, please ###

I am not the author of original software. All rights belong to developers who made all the libraries and scripts required for this software to run.
The main point of it is experimenting with original code and getting new results from existing features, also adding something new.
Main difference: this is the only Linux-compatible fork of Rope, and what do I mean by that is original Rope will work, but you can't change anything in GUI (scroll does not work).

Huge thanks to [Hillobar](https://github.com/Hillobar) for creating Rope and helping out with bugfixes in EX version.

### Changelog v191123-e2 "Sapphire EX" ###
- Imported all the features from latest Rope update: some bugfixes and mask view mode.
- Now MouthParser supports values as low as -50 for whole mouth and as high as 50 for mouth & lower lip only. (Works in different direction compared to original Rope)

### Changelog v191123 "Sapphire EX" ###
- Now GUI is fully compatible with Linux-based systems. Models now able to load, scrolling to increase/decrease values now works too.
- Experimental Occluder opacity feature, feel free to test it out.
- Other minor changes that are 100% are here, but I don't remember making them.
