### Project is closed, but Wiki for Linux users is still available

Since Rope now changed its backend it seems like Linux-based systems are fully supported.
But if for some unknown reasons you may need to test out old Rope versions on Linux, check out dev branch.

Installation instructions and troubleshooting in wiki are probably still up-to-date, so you can use them to install Rope to your Linux-based machine.

Sincerely,
Aqua
